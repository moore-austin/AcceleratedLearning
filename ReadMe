 A Location-Based Note Visualization Application  August 2022 – Present
The Location-Based Note Taking application I’m working on takes in a users database (files, notes, and images from Google Drive or Evernote) and outputs various data visualization images, videos, and interactive maps which allow the user to know what files they have, and where they have stored them. This ability will increase a person's creativity and performance.
This is accomplished through the Memory Palace Memorization Technique (currently used by almost all World Memory Championship competitors such as Kim Surim). The technique uses the brain's location-based memory to store large amounts of data for practical & creative purposes.
One main output of this application is to automatically display database files in a real location on Google Maps tiles via Folium (i.e. Images of files transposed onto GPS coordinates in your neighborhood that you can walk through physically and mentally). This automatically builds a Memory Palace for the user by programmatically emulating a World Memory Champion’s techniques.
The current scope of this project is to help its creator, me, memorize the locations of 10,000+ files accumulated over the past decade to aid in various personal/intellectual pursuits. A publicly accessible GitHub version of this project is coming soon.


Reach out to me if you have any questions about my code or the ideas behind the code.
